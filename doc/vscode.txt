You can do this with Build commands:

Create a simple tsconfig.json with "watch": true (this will instruct compiler to watch all compiled files):

{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "out": "js/script.js",
        "watch": true
    }
}

Note that files array is omitted, by default all *.ts files in all subdirectories will be compiled. You can provide any other parameters or change target/out, just make sure that watch is set to true.

Configure your task (Ctrl+Shift+P -> Configure Task Runner):

{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "tsc",
    "showOutput": "silent",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "problemMatcher": "$tsc"
}

Now press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the project. You will see compiler output in the output window (Ctrl+Shift+U).

The compiler will compile files automatically when saved. To stop the compilation, press Ctrl+P -> > Tasks: Terminate Running Task

I've created a project template specifically for this answer: typescript-node-basic
