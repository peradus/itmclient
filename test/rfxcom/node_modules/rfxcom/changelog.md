Version 1.0.0
-------------

First production release

Added (almost) complete transmit & receive support for **all** packet types supported by 433 MHz hardware and firmware
version 1020, with the exception of:
* 0x1C, Edisio (868 MHz)
* 0x21, Security2
* 0x53, Barometric sensors (currently unused)
* 0x5E, Gas sensors (currently unused)
* 0x5F, Water sensors (currently unused)
* 0x72, FS20 (868 MHz)
* 0x7F, Raw transmit

Other enhancements:
- Added extra subtypes and commands to lighting5 (though there are still one or two missing)
- Added a sendRaw() method to Transmitter to allow *any* packet type to be sent (including the 0x7F raw packet, if required)
- Improved unit tests (unit tests are no longer installed by npm)
- For firmware versions that support it, the RF transmitter power is reported in the `status` event
- Transmitters for all packet types now accept an (optional) options parameter. Currently only Lighting4 and Rfy make use of it
- Added a "receiverstarted" event
- Added scripts to find all RFXCOM devices attached to a computer (`find-rfxcom`), and to manage the enabled receive protocols (`set-protocols`)

Breaking changes:
- Curtain1 constructor now requires a subtype
- Lighting5 `switchOn()` method no longer accepts a parameter to set moods & levels - use `setMood()` & `setLevel()` instead
- Rfy venetian blinds commands are no longer duplicated in EU & US variants, e.g. `venetianOpenEU()` & `venetianOpenUS`
are relaced by `venetianOpen()`. An options parameter to the Rfy constructor sets which variant is used, e.g. `{venetianBlindsMode: "EU"}`
- Receive data events now correspond strictly one-to-one with received packet types. Previously, some of the 'sensor' 
events corresponded with subtypes. For example, the `thb1` and `thb2` events from the two different subtypes of the
temperature, humidity and barometric pressure sensing devices (packet type 0x54) are replaced by a single `temphumbaro` event.
- Adopted the use of camelCase for all event properties, so that `unitcode` is now `unitCode`, and housecode is now `houseCode`

  contributed by @freakent.
- Bump to serialport ~1.4.

Version 0.7.7
-------------

- Change tbX messages to tbhX messages and fix typo in battery level
  determination.

Version 0.7.6
-------------

- Handle the rfxmeter and tempbaro messages.

Version 0.7.5
-------------

- Implement support for rfxmeter and tempbaro sensors from bwired-nl.

Version 0.7.2
-------------

- Added additional event "received" with the raw data that was received from the
  device contributed by @iangregory.
- Added save() method to the rfxcom object, allowing saving the configured
  protocols to the NVRAM of the rfxtrx433, the SDK cautions against using this
  too often as there is a limited number of writes (10K).

Version 0.7.1
-------------

- Add additional protocol defines for use when configuring the device,
  contributed by @njh.

Version 0.7.0
-------------

- Changes the format of the lighting2 event, the subtype will correspond to the

- Split the tests appropriately.
- Rename the LightwaveRf prototype to Lighting5. *backwards incompatible*
- Made the new Lighting5 prototype accept different types.
- Removed RfxCom.lightOn and RfxCom.lightOff because these were LightwaveRf
  specific.

-------------

- Added support for lighting2 received messages.
- Renamed signalStrength to rssi in keeping with the RFX TRX SDK document.

- Added .initialise to the RfxCom prototype, which handles bootstrapping the
  device.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

- Change the LightwaveRf device identifier format to 0x010203/1 which means that
  it is possible to define device as strings e.g. FRONT_LIGHT = "0x010203/1".

Version 0.2.3
-------------

- Add support for TH1-9 temperature and humidity sensors.

Version 0.2.2
